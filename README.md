Setting

```
"In sum, our city's motto should be this: 'Visit Blisterport to change. Stay to learn that nothing ever changes.'" 
- Flores, Penelope, "A Brief History of Failure." Workers' Party. 1 Oct. 1919.

- The Mantakalas are a Caribbean island chain and United States territory since 1898. Their capital is the city of Blisterport.
- The islands are affected by their proximity to the Well, an eldritch power in the Cayman Trench deep beneath the sea.
- The Well causes involuntary and unpredictable transformation in humans, and has also spawned a variety of plants and animals unique to the area.
- Since 1916, transformation can be reversed or controlled voluntarily with devices called sculpt-boxes.
- Sculpt-boxes are made using special crystals found in whale-like creatures called Iblit.
- Since the end of the Great War, The Mantakalas have become an increasingly popular tourist destination, enriching some residents but uprooting many others.

Introduction

Dante Ruiz Soriano has requested your presence at his estate on the island of Miramar. Señor Dante is one of only a few old-money aristocrats still residing in The Mantakalas, the rest of his family having fled to the United States during the 1917 Summer Uprising. An eccentric and recluse, he is said to never leave his family’s plantation house, and in recent years is reputed to have developed a dilettante’s interest in the occult. As Investigators of the Unknown, you board the next available ferry from Blisterport Harbor to answer the call.

Character Creation Notes

- The Mantakalas are an entirely safe setting for your character to be openly queer.
- The most convenient native language for your character would be either Spanish or English. You will encounter tourists and sailors who speak a variety of other languages as well.
- Your character will start with a transformed body to which they are acclimated. This is called your "base form."
- Your base form may change with time, or in response to physical or psychological stress.
- For balance, your starting base form should ideally provide both benefits and detriments to your character.

Transformation Rules

- Sculptors can be hired to transform your character. The more drastic the transformation, the more expensive and time-consuming the process.
- Transformations can buff or debuff stats, but all such affected stats take a penalty die until your character is acclimated.
- Acclimation takes 2d12 hours, with more time needed for more drastic transformations.
- Because the Well is more powerful than any human sculptor, changes made with sculpt-boxes are temporary. After sculpting, your character will revert to their base form in around three days.
- Transformation can be resisted by rolling POW with a Hard success. This roll can be pushed.

Other Info

- Rather than tracking money numerically, a binary yes/no on whether your character can afford something will be used. For edge cases, a Credit Rating roll will be used.
- Any purchase necessary to an ongoing investigation (or which you can persuade your client is necessary) can be expensed.
- This campaign adds a new skill called City Knowledge which covers things like navigation, familiarity with the character of specific neighborhoods, and local history.
